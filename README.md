# WhatsApp Bot

A WhatsApp bot that can tag all members in a group chat. Built with Node.js and [whatsapp-web.js](https://wwebjs.dev/).

More features coming soon. ðŸš€

Hopefully I'll not forget to update the docs when I add a new feature lol

## Features

- Tag all members in a group chat using a command
- QR code generation for WhatsApp Web authentication
- Auto mark messages as read
- Health check endpoint

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A WhatsApp account
- Git

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/firesolami/whatsapp-bot.git
cd whatsapp-bot
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm i
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
PORT=3000
WA_USERNAME="your-name"
WA_PHONE_NUMBER="your-whatsapp-number@c.us"
WA_BOT_PHONE_NUMBER="bot-whatsapp-number"

ENDPOINT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

4. Start the bot:

```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:

```bash

5. When first starting the bot, scan the QR code available at:

```
http://localhost:3000/qr/your-endpoint-secret
```
